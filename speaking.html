            5/10 What about those other books? Who set our current Bible, and how. Why our Bible is different from the Catholic Bible. What about all that other stuff (Dead Sea Scrolls, "lost books of the Bible," Josephus, etc.)? Can I believe the documentaries on Netflix? <br><br>
 
5/17 Which translation is the best? Why shouldn't everyone use the KJV? The different kinds of translations and editions of the Bible, and how you can benefit from all of them. Why we shouldn't be arguing over this.  <br><br>
 
5/24 How to study your Bible ... for yourself, part 1. Seven questions to ask of every passage. Examples of the variety of Bible study methods, published helps, and digital resources. A study assignment for the entire class.  <br><br>
 
5/31 How to study your Bible ... for yourself, part 2. Reviewing and discussing what we learned from the assignment.  How to use the original languages (and how to avoid common mistakes).  <br><br>

            3/8 Finding your way through the Bible: How to go from Genesis to Revelation without getting lost.  A survey of the structure, literature, and uniqueness of Scripture.  It's more than a book! <br><br>
 
3/15 The Key to the Bible: Summing up the entire book in one sentence (OK, it's a run-on sentence).  How everything in Scripture revolves around Christ. <br><br>
 
3/22 How the Bible came to us: From ancient manuscripts to our modern Bibles.  Stories of OT Hebrew scrolls, Greek parchments, and reverent scribes.  In all the world, there is no other book like this one! <br><br>
 
3/29 What does it mean that the Bible is "inspired"?  How do we know that the BIble is truly God's word?  The differences between revelation, inspiration, illumination, and application.  <br><br>
