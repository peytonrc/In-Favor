                    Jim was a recipient of the Clergy Renewal Grant from the Eli Lilly Foundation. The grant enabled him
                    to
                    travel over three months to four countries and seven states, interviewing city leaders and pastors
                    in
                    communities experiencing unusual spiritual transformation. The principles he learned set the
                    direction
                    for the rest of his life and ministry, and he has shared them with pastors’ groups and town leaders,
                    at
                    retreats and at conferences.
